#PROJECT PRESENTATION:

Part 1 - Data crawling from booking
In this part, we used BeautifulSoup to scrape hotel information from booking.com, such as name, location, rating, and price. We collected data from 10 different cities across the world and stored them in CSV files.

Part 2 - Cleaning and formatting the data
In this part, we performed some data cleaning and formatting tasks, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting data types, and standardizing the units. We also created some new features, such as price per night and distance from the city center.

Part 3 - EDA Visualization
In this part, we explored the data using various visualization techniques, such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps. We analyzed the distribution of hotel ratings and prices across different cities and regions. We also examined the relationship between hotel features and customer satisfaction.

Part 4 - ML Machine learning model
In this part, we applied two machine learning models to predict the hotel rating based on the hotel features. We used DecisionTreeClassifier and KNN as our classifiers and evaluated their performance using accuracy. We also performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize our models.
